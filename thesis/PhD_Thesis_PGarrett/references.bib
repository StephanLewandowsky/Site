volume="8",
number="4",
pages="698--707",
abstract="Humans appear to share with animals a nonverbal counting process. In a nonverbal counting condition, subjects pressed a key a numeral-specified number of times, while saying ``the'' at every press. The mean number of presses increased as a power function of the target number, with a constant coefficient of variation (c.v.), both within and beyond the proposed subitizing range (1--4 or 5), suggesting small numbers are represented on the same continuum as larger numbers and subject to the same noise process (scalar variability). By contrast, when subjects counted their presses out loud as fast as they could, the c.v. decreased as the inverse square root of the target value (binomial variability instead of scalar variability). The unexpected power-law relation between target value and mean number of presses in nonverbal counting suggests a new hypothesis about the development of the function relating number symbols to mental magnitudes.",

abstract = { Binocular processing was investigated using a quantitative, process-oriented metatheory of response times. The analyses are not confined to particular distributional assumptions or specific models. Upper and lower performance boundaries for probability summation in parallel processing are defined and compared with observed distributions of reaction times using a variety of dichoptic stimuli. Performance that exceeds the upper bound strongly suggests facilitatory convergence between the two eyes (binocular channel summation). Performance below the lower bound suggests that inputs to the two eyes are processed serially. The results indicate that binocular channel summation in subjects with normal stereo vision requires targets of the same luminance polarity (paired increments or decrements) in corresponding retinal locations. When corresponding retinal locations are stimulated with opposing luminance polarities (increment to one eye, decrement to the other), performance is consistent with probability summation, indicating that parallel ON and OFF pathways remain segregated at least to the level of binocular fusion. Further analyses of data from a stereo-blind observer suggest serial processing of binocular inputs. }

abstract="In this paper, we analyze how different information-processing architectures deal with conflicting information. A robust finding in psychological research is that response times are slower when processing conflicting sources of information (e.g., naming the color of the word RED when printed in green in the well-known Stroop task) than when processing congruent sources of information (e.g., naming the color of the word GREEN when printed in green). We suggest that the effect of conflicting information depends on the processing architectures and derive a new measure of information processing called the conflict contrast function, which is indicative of how different architectures perform with conflicts at different levels of salience. By varying the salience of the conflicting information source, we show that serial, parallel, and coactive information processing architectures predict qualitatively distinct conflict contrast functions. We provide new analyses of three previously collected data sets: a detection task with Stroop color-word stimuli and two categorization experiments. Our novel measure provides convergent evidence about the underlying processing architecture in the categorization tasks and surprising results in the Stroop detection task.",

abstract="Reaction time distributions were obtained from practiced subjects in a go/no-go detection task with attention divided across the visual and auditory modalities. Redundant signals were sometimes presented asynchronously on the two modalities, with the time between signals varying from 0 to 167 msec. An extension of the inequality derived by Miller (1982) was used to test between separate-decisions models, in which the response is initiated solely by whichever signal is detected first, and coactivation models, in which both signals contribute to the activation of a single response. As in previous studies with bimodal detection tasks, the results contradicted separate-decisions models and favored coactivation models. The largest violations of separate-decisions models were observed when the visual signal was presented 67--100 msec before the auditory signal. A new inequality was also derived to discriminate between two classes of coactivation models that differ about whether responses are generated by processes combining activation across time as well as across signals. Violations of this inequality ruled out exponential coactivation models, in which activation processes are sensitive only to the instantaneous properties of the signal(s). Instead, the results require an accumulation model of coactivation, in which both signals provide input to a process that accumulates activation over a considerable period of time, even if signal conditions change during that time.",

abstract = {A mathematical characterization of serial, parallel and hybrid processes is given, and this characterization is related to several current experimental paradigms. Non‐identifiability (mimicking) between two systems (i.e. models of systems) is defined as equivalence of probability distributions on element completion times for the two systems, where n elements are available for processing by each. Results are then presented for a class of systems with exponential processing times, and it is seen that several interesting cases of parallel and serial systems are equivalent to systems of the opposite type. Evidence that will allow accurate discrimination between parallel and serial processing for this and other classes of systems either requires more complete and precise information about the actual probability distributions of the systems or more specialized sets of converging operations than is usually obtained in psychological experimentation. For example, it is noted that at the level of first moments (means), even a parallel independent system can predict results usually associated with a serial system (an overall increasing linear mean reaction time curve as a function of the number of elements to be processed). Next, a functional equation is developed that must hold in order for mimicking to occur between parallel and serial systems within the same general family of probability distributions, and three special cases are examined. A parallel system with gamma‐distributed processing times for element completion is then investigated, and it is shown that a strictly serial system cannot mimic it, but an interesting hybrid system can. This is followed by discussion of two kinds of partial identifiability, mimicking at the level of means and possible predicted differences at higher levels, and mimicking by approximation. Some qualitative considerations that may enter into conclusions as to parallelity or seriality of processing are then introduced. Last, it is suggested that in a broad sense questions related to parallel and serial systems concern fundamental aspects of information‐processing structure and distribution of processing energy and hence merit further mathematical investigation.}

abstract = { In a nonverbal counting task derived from the animal literature, adult human subjects repeatedly attempted to produce target numbers of key presses at rates that made vocal or subvocal counting difficult or impossible. In a second task, they estimated the number of flashes in a rapid, randomly timed sequence. Congruent with the animal data, mean estimates in both tasks were proportional to target values, as was the variability in the estimates. Converging evidence makes it unlikely that subjects used verbal counting or time durations to perform these tasks. The results support the hypothesis that adult humans share with nonverbal animals a system for representing number by magnitudes that have scalar variability (a constant coefficient of variation). The mapping of numerical symbols to mental magnitudes provides a formal model of the underlying nonverbal meaning of the symbols (a model of numerical semantics). }
