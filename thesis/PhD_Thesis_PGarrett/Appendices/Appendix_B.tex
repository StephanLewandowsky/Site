\section{Workload capacity}
The following displays capacity coefficient workload functions for every individual reported in the subitizing task of Chapter 4. Each subplot displays a single participant, the black line denotes the capacity coefficient and the broken line denotes the Grice lower-bound. For every individual, capacity coefficients hover at or below the Grice bound for most of the response-time range indicating severely limited workload capacity. This result replicated across experiments, presented as separate figures.
