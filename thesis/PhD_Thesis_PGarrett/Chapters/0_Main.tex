\acknowledgements{\addtocontents{toc}{\vspace{1em}}
Firstly, I wish to acknowledge the outstanding mentorship provided by my primary supervisor, Associate Professor Ami Eidels. Ami has shaped me into the scientist I am today. Ami always made time for me, to guide me as a scientist, as an academic, and as a mentor to other students. Learning from him has been the greatest privilege of my PhD. It was from Ami that I learned the principles to which I aspire everyday.

\begin{center} 
\textit{``Have patience with your work. Have more with the work of others.''}

\textit{``Tell the truth and tell it simply, everything after that is their problem.''}

\textit{``Be kind. Kindness is one of the few currencies that count in research. \\Be kind to others. Be kind to yourself.''}

\end{center}

Secondly, I wish to thank my co-supervisor, Professor Scott Brown. Ever available, quick to laugh and keen to help. You contribution to this thesis cannot be measured in words, code or data; your contribution was the collaborative lab you made, the students you fostered and the support you always gave, unconditionally. 

To the Newcastle cognition lab and the students that made it a home --- Laura Wall, Caroline Kuhne, Nathan Evans, Gavin Cooper, Reilly Innes, Angus McKerral, Ashlea Rendell, J.P. Cavallaro, Asheek Shimul \& Erin Robinson --- this thesis was possible because of you. Like all students who attempt a PhD, there were days when I struggled to think, to write, and to teach. On those days (and every other) you supported me with fun, love, insight and most of all coffee. I wish to specially thank my constant companion, Zachary Howard, who was with me at every step of this journey and often reached down to help me stand tall. To Alexander Thorpe, Laura Waters and Murray Bennett, I could not have asked for better students, colleagues, and friends. It was my privilege and a source of constant pride to have taught and to have learned from each of you.

To the administration staff at the University of Newcastle --- Brendan Tisdell, Tara Magnay, Jess Fitzpatrick, and above all Danielle Storey --- thank you for your help and your friendship. Whether I was booking last minute flights, haphazardly searching for documents, or in one case, lost without accommodation in Boston, your skills, support, kindness, and genuine care were always felt and appreciated.

To Associate Professor Daniel Little and my research family at the University of Melbourne, your support has meant everything to me. In particular, I wish to thank Sarah Moneer, Christina Van-Heer, Xue Jun, Jess Marris, Jason Zhou, Gabriel Ong, Ariel Goh, Marcellin Martinie, and Felix Singleton Thorn. Your friendship, love and support have kept me sane throughout my move to Melbourne and the writing of this thesis. 

To the vast network of academics who have taught me these past four years, thank you. Although there are too many to list, I wish to thank Simon Dennis, Hyungwook Yim, James Townsend, Joseph Houpt, Daniel Little, Cheng-Ta Yang, Guy Hawkins, Philip Smith, Simon Lilburn, Emily Freeman, Kerry Charlmers, and David Landy. Above all, I wish to thank my oldest colleague, mentor and friend, Dr Patrick Cooper.

Finally, to my family back in Newcastle and in particular, my loving partner Zoe. On every step of this journey, from my Bachelors through to this thesis, I have had your unwavering support. Although my name may appear on the doctorate, this achievement is yours too.}

Quantities and numbers have shaped the collective course of human history, governing trade, science, mathematics, and warfare. The cognitive mechanisms that allow us to compare two quantities, or identify one numeral from another, are not well understood. In this thesis, I investigate the processes that govern numerical cognition. I present a series of investigations that identify how we combine information from two large quantities and two small quantities. Specifically, I identify the processing architecture (parallel vs serial) and workload capacity (efficiency) of these cognitive processing systems. I then extend this work with a simulation study to develop a new set of distributional signatures that can be used to identify mixtures of parallel and serial processing architectures. Finally, I engage in a cross-cultural investigation into the mental representations of numbers. By using confusion scores, I model the mental representations of Arabic, Thai, Chinese and dot numerals, in an English speaking and Chinese speaking cohort. This investigation shows how mental representations change with levels of expertise. This thesis develops new methods and analysis techniques, and provides new insight into the fundamental processes that govern numerical cognition.}
